# mangadlmao

A cli script to download and package manga into CBZ for [Komga].

What sets it apart from other scripts like this is that it creates
a `ComicInfo.xml` for [Komga] and it will also download any updated chapters
to get the latest versions with fixes.

File modified times are used to track which chapters have already been downloaded.

Note: The API for Semantic Versioning purposes is considered the configuration file and cli
options. Every python module contained in this package is internal and subject to breaking
changes at any time.

## Installation

Install using [pip]:

```console
$ python -m pip install mangadlmao
```

## Usage

This script is primarily meant to be used with a [configuration file](#configuration).

However, there are some command line arguments that can be used:

```console
$ mangadlmao --help
Usage: mangadlmao [OPTIONS] [URL]...

  Download Manga from the configuration file or URL arguments.

Options:
  -v, --verbose       More verbose messages
  -c, --config PATH   Print or set configuration file path.
  -j, --jobs INTEGER  Number of parallel chapter page downloads.  [default: 4]
  -l, --lang TEXT     Language to download when URLs are given, can be
                      provided multiple times.
  -e, --exclude TEXT  Scanlation groups and users to exclude, can be provided
                      multiple times.
  -s, --since TEXT    Download only chapters updated after specified date
                      (eg.: 2022-02-22). If set to 'auto', only chapters newer
                      than the most recent will be downloaded. If set to
                      'null' (default), all chapters will be downloaded.
  -f, --from FLOAT    Download only chapters starting from provided number
  --help              Show this message and exit.
```

The default download directory is the current directory. You can change it through the
[configuration file](#configuration).

## Configuration

You can get the location of the configuration file by running `mangadlmao -c`
or specify a custom path with `mangadlmao --config=/custom/location/config.yml`

The configuration file format is YAML:

```yaml
---
download_directory: "."

# default "since", can be null, a date, or auto (default: auto)
# - null: download everything
# - auto: download only chapters newer than the most recently created local chapter
# - a date: eg.: 2022-02-22, only chapters updated after the date will be downloaded
since: auto

# default languages to download, can be overridden per manga
lang:
  - en

# global exclude for groups and users, can be name or id
exclude:
  - TerribleMachineTranslator
  - 33171bc6-0c2a-40d7-9cca-120ac52f09ae

manga:
  # entries with url can be either MangaDex or MangaSee
  - url: https://mangadex.org/title/15931821-1a3a-4aee-b27c-1c95d8d5dcf1/hololive-yohane-s-twitter-shorts
    title: Hololive Shorts by Yohane
    # override default "since" setting:
    since: 2020-12-24
    # only download chapters starting from chapter number 69
    from: 69
    # override default languages (only works for MangaDex):
    lang: [en, de]
    # additional group and user excludes (only works for MangaDex):
    exclude:
      - AnotherTerribleMachineTranslator

  # entries with id are treated as MangaDex entries
  - title: Nice Manga Title
    id: aed22b2e-b544-4204-9702-cdf5cfc167de

  # entries with rss are currently treated as MangaSee entries
  - title: Manga 69
    rss: https://mangasee/rss/Manga-69.xml
    since: 2020-12-24
    # lang has no effect with MangaSee
```

The `title` key is optional but because it is used as directory name, if the name changes
server-side, all chapters will be re-downloaded into a new directory.
